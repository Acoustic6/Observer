Programming in the way like 

measurmentsChanged() {
currentConditionDisplay.Update(temperature, humidity, pressure);
forecastDisplay.Update(temperature, humidity, pressure);
statisticsDisplay.Update(temperature, humidity, pressure);
}

we program using certain realization. Which does not let us to change displays 
without making changes in measurmentsChanged() method.

We are fixing it here.
